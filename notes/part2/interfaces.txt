Interfaces are for what should be done where classes are how they should be done.

Dependency Injection:
    - Classes should not instantiate their dependencies. The TaxReport class should not be
      responsible for creating an instance of TaxCalculator but rather use it. We keep the
      responsibilities separate.
    - Dependency injection describes the idea of passing references of classes to the
      constructors, setters, and methods rather than creating an instance inside. A class'
      responsibility is to modify the state and behavior of objects its passed and shouldn't
      care about creating objects.

Try to keep the amount of methods in interfaces small.

Interface Segregation Principle:
    - We should divide big interfaces into smaller ones

In Java, classes cannot have multiple parents but interfaces can. Interfaces can extend multiple
where classes cannot. Classes however can implement as many interfaces we need.
