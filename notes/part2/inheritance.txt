Core pillars of OOP
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

Abstract classes are for when we wouldn't instantiate an instance of it as it's abstract by nature.

Final classes are for when we are 1,000% sure another class will never extend it (very rarely used).

Avoid creating deep inheritance hierarchies.

Java creators have decided to restrict inheritance to a single class to remove potential added complexity and ambiguity.
